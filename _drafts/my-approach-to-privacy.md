Those who know me also know that I am enthusiastic about technology. I like to keep on the bleeding edge even if I end up (figuratively) bleeding because of it. For a long time, this meant that I was an early adopter of  all sorts of software or internet services.

But alas, that time has seemingly come to an end.

However, I also care deeply about keeping control of my data and preserving my privacy.

Unfortunately, the business model of an ever increasing part of the internet is now based on tracking you, mining your data and  selling it to advertisers. At the same time, governments across the world are 


 This means that I am forced to research and to make some hard choices every now and then.

Since I think this might be useful to others, here is basically an opinionated list of the services and software I have made a conscious choice to use or to avoid, as well as any good mitigating strategies.

## Web browsing

I have Safari, Chrome and Firefox installed.

**Safari** is my web browser of choice. I disable all plug-ins  (including Flash), allow cookies only from the current site and ask websites not to track me. I use the extensions for Ghostery (blocking everything), DirectLinks, 1Password and AdBlock. I delete all web browsing data (including cookies) every few days.

I use **Chrome** to access Facebook and some Google services when I want to be logged in (e.g. Google Scholar).

I use **Firefox** when I need to use Java or another plug-in.

## Social media

**Facebook** is a privacy disaster. It not only tracks you while you use their website, but it also follows you throughout the web because of those dreadful "Like" buttons. It's also the single worst way to get your news.

I keep a Facebook profile which I use to keep in touch with people I contact only occasionally. I don't "like" pages, add/accept people I don't know personally.

**Twitter** is reasonable in terms of privacy. 

**LinkedIn** is probably useful if you're desperate for a job. But if you're not and you're technically savvy, why not you make a choice to *own* your professional identity by making your own website?

## Messaging

I currently have accounts on Telegram, iMessage and Signal.

**Signal** is clearly the best in terms of privacy, but hardly anyone I know uses it.

**iMessage** seems to be [pretty good](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/) in terms of privacy. It is end-to-end encrypted.

**Telegram** has been the subject of serious criticism, but in my opinion, it still seems pretty secure. Most of the criticism is based on it following its own not-so-tested protocol and a lot of it is politically motivated (like the stupid argument that it is used by terrorists).

I had a **WhatsApp** account which I closed when it was bought by Facebook. For a long time it seemed like WhatsApp was going on a good direction, implementing end-to-end encryption and respecting the promises made to its users. I was even about to re-open my account! However, now Facebook made it clear that it intends to mine your address book (and likely all possible metadata) for targeted advertising.

## E-mail

For a lack of a better reasonably priced option, I am stuck using **Gmail**.

I also have my own **self-hosted** e-mail server on a DigitalOcean VPS. It works, but securely configuring and managing it all is *very* difficult.

## The Cloud

I have a **Dropbox** account which I use to share files. Nothing remotely privacy-sensitive goes there.

I use **iCloud** to store my contacts, calendars and to-dos. I don't use it for files, pictures, passwords or web browsing data.
