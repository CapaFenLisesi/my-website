Pollution in Mexico City has been a problem for decades.
I remember my childhood in the early 1990s as a time of always-grey skies, cheap leaded petrol, and rather believable tales of [birds dying and falling from the sky](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-02-04/news/8601090418_1_pollution-levels-mexico-city-dead-birds).
In 1992, Mexico City earned the dubious distinction of the most polluted city on the planet.
Many people were outraged[^1].

Nowadays the skies are mostly blue and the situation is much improved, which is a real achievement considering the rather inauspicious location of Mexico City in a closed valley more than 2 km above sea level[^2].
This improvement was no coincidence.
Tough actions followed the worst years of the pollution crisis, including closing down an oil refinery, moving many factories outside the city and forcing all cars to do twice-yearly emission controls.

However, the most forward-looking reaction was perhaps the creation of a city-wide pollution measurement system, which is now known as [SIMAT](http://www.aire.cdmx.gob.mx).
The system is a big success
The pollution data is accurate and widely used.

, its data is now used by many providers and plenty of people in Mexico City check the pollution levels more frequently than the weather forecast[^4].
