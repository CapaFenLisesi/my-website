One of my favourite work-related topics of conversation is

I'm always looking for ways to 

## OS and Hardware

After getting increasingly fed up with the bad state of Windows circa 2000, I switched to Linux (various flavours), then to BeOS (bought by Palm) and finally to Mac OS in 2002. Admittedly, Mac OS 9 had no pre-emptive multitasking and Mac OS X was a slow mess back then (10.1), but I've been a mostly happy Mac user ever since. At this point, I'd find difficult to switch to another OS since many of my favourite applications are only available on Mac.

However, on servers I do prefer to run Linux or something derived from BSD. For one, our [group website](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl) is hosted on an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS VPS. I don't have a clear preference for any Linux distribution, but having something Debian-based makes things easier. I'd also be fine with something like NetBSD.

Regarding hardware, these days I use a 15" MacBook Pro with Retina Display, 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD. It's a great machine and I'm very happy with it.

In the past, I had an iMac for work and a personal laptop. This worked well enough, but it's much more convenient to have a single computer. Keeping things synchronised is difficult, and especially so if you care about your privacy and don't want to put all your documents on the cloud.

## Programming

For complex tasks and when I know what I'm doing, I do my programming in C++. High-level languages are just too slow for much of what I do. I use Xcode as an IDE with Clang and LLVM. These days I'm slowly switching over to C++14.

When I don't know how an idea will work out and I thus need to do some quick prototyping, I use either Ruby or Python. The same goes for simple scripts to solve one-time problems. I find Ruby much more pleasant to use, but it has few GIS-related libraries. Python is not my cup of tea, but every GIS library seems to have bindings for it.
