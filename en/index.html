				<h1>About me</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/">3D geoinformation</a> group of the <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a>, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqEh0iFWlgs">Netherlands</a>.
				I graduated from the MSc in Geomatics programme in Delft, and the BSc in Computer Science and Technology from the <a href="http://www.itesm.edu/">Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</a> in <a href="http://vimeo.com/15068747">Mexico City</a>, where I was born and lived until 2008.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of my current research is about higher dimensional (4D and higher) data models, data structures and algorithms for Geographic Information Systems.
				I am also interested in other topics that combine geometric/topological computing and real-world spatial information, such as the validation and repair of geographic data, point clouds and surface reconstruction, topological data structures, and visualising spatial data.
				I like theoretical work, but I strongly believe in implementing my ideas in actual working (free) software.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from my work, I like many things: (certain) music, travel, photography, progressive politics, human rights and privacy, literature, science and technology, languages, trains and public transport, geography, typography and urbanism (in no particular order).
				I am always willing and happy to have a good coffee and a nice chat about work or any of these topics.
