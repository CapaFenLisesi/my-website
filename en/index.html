				<h1>About me</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl/">3D geoinformation</a> group of the <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a>, in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqEh0iFWlgs">Netherlands</a>.
				<!-- I am also involved in teaching for the course GEO1002 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Cartography, and in <a href="http://promood.nl/">Promood</a>, the representative body of PhDs at the university. -->
				I graduated from the <a href="http://geomatics.tudelft.nl/">MSc in Geomatics</a> programme in Delft, and the <a href="http://www.itesm.edu/wps/wcm/connect/itesm/tecnologico+de+monterrey/carreras+profesionales/areas+de+estudio/tecnologias+de+informacion+y+electronica/itc">BSc in Computer Science and Technology</a> from the <a href="http://www.itesm.edu/">Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</a> in <a href="http://vimeo.com/15068747">Mexico City</a>, where I was born and lived until 2008.

				Most of my current research is about higher dimensional (4D and higher) data models, data structures and algorithms for GIS.
				I am also interested in other topics that combine geometric/topological computing and GIS, such as the validation and repair of data, working with point clouds and surface reconstruction, topological data structures, and visualising spatial data.
				I like theoretical work, but I strongly believe in implementing my ideas in actual working (free) software.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from my work, I love many things: music, travel, photography, politics, human rights and privacy, literature, science and technology, languages, trains and public transport, geography, math, urbanism and cinema (in no particular order).
				I am always willing and happy to have a good coffee and nice chat about work or any of these topics.
