				<h1>About me</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				I am a postdoc researcher at the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/">3D geoinformation</a> group of the <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a> in the Netherlands, now working mostly remotely from Mexico City.
				I did my PhD on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/thesis/">Higher-dimensional modelling of geographic information</a> and the MSc in Geomatics programme in Delft, and the BSc in Computer Science and Technology from the <a href="http://www.itesm.edu/">Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</a> in Mexico City.
			</p>
			<p>
				Much of my current research is about higher-dimensional (4D and higher) data models, data structures and algorithms for Geographic Information Systems, using these dimensions to model not only space, but also other characteristics such as time and scale.
				I am also interested in other topics that combine geometric/topological computing and spatial information, such as geometric modelling, the validation and repair of geographic data, topological data structures, and visualising spatial data.
				I like theoretical work, but what I enjoy most is implementing my ideas into working prototypes and, when they are serious enough, into <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/code/">free software</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from my work, I am passionate about travelling and learning about the world, as well as about the arts, science and technology.
				I strongly believe in free, tolerant and multicultural societies, and I support all sorts of progressive politics, especially when these relate to diversity, human rights and privacy, science and technology, and the internet.
				I like many things, including photography, languages, trains and public transport, typography, progressive rock, jazz and classical music.
				I dislike advertising, most forms of intellectual property and all forms of sports.
