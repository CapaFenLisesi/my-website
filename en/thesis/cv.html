				Gustavo Adolfo <a href="http://ken.mx"><strong>Ken Arroyo Ohori</strong></a> was born on June 12, 1985 in Mexico City. He graduated in 2003 from the Bicultural High School (`\emph{Preparatoria Bicultural}') programme and in 2007 from the BSc in Computer Science and Technology programme (`\emph{ITC01: Ingenier\'\i{}a en Tecnolog\'\i{}as Computacionales}') at the Mexico City campus of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education (`\emph{Instituto Tecnol\'ogico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey}').

				Arriving to the Delft University of Technology in 2008, Ken graduated from the MSc in Geomatics programme in 2010 with his thesis on the \emph{Validation and automatic repair of planar partitions using a constrained triangulation}, which later evolved into some of the data repair ideas exposed in \refch{ch:cleaning} of this thesis.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				In 2011, Ken started his PhD project on the \emph{Higher-dimensional modelling of geographic information}, supervised by \href{https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/}{Jantien Stoter} and \href{http://tudelft.nl/hledoux}{Hugo Ledoux}, working under the umbrella of the project \emph{5D Data Modelling: Full Integration of 2D/3D Space, Time and Scale Dimensions} of the Dutch Technology Foundation (\emph{STW}). In October 2012, he visited \href{http://liris.cnrs.fr/guillaume.damiand/}{Guillaume Damiand}, collaborating on the incremental construction method that later became \refch{ch:incremental-construction} of this thesis.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">
				In 2016, Ken started working as a postdoc in the same \emph{5D Data Modelling} project, focusing on 4D visualisation and in the integrated modelling of space and time.
