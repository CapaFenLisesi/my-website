				<li class="text-justify">Using higher-dimensional topological data structures, many difficult problems can be flattened to equivalent&mdash;but conceptually simpler&mdash;problems on graphs. <em>[This thesis]</em></li>
				<li class="text-justify">Two representations will come to dominate geographic information of any dimension: point clouds and space subdivisions. <em>[This thesis]</em></li>
				<li class="text-justify">Computational methods will replace geoscientific methods in almost every GIS application: <em>fast reasonable approximations</em> on large noisy datasets will increasingly trump <em>slow optimal solutions</em> on a few carefully acquired data points.</li>
				<li class="text-justify">A lack of concern for geometric and topological correctness is the main reason behind the lack of successful applications for general-purpose 3D models.</li>
				<li class="text-justify">In computer science, it is almost always better to speak of research objectives than research questions.</li>
				<li class="text-justify">There is no such thing as a predatory publisher, only predatory metrics used to gauge the value of a scientist.</li>
				<li class="text-justify">In the future, peer review will be conducted post publication.</li>
				<li class="text-justify">Good academic writing advice encourages clarity and expressiveness as much as it discourages formulaic constructions.</li>
				<li class="text-justify">Innovation in internet services will occur in countries that enshrine net neutrality in law.</li>
				<li class="text-justify">The results of research performed at public universities or using public funds ought to be released into the public domain.</li>
