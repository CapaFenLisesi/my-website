Hello there!

I'm Ken Arroyo Ohori, a soon-to-be-finished PhD candidate[^1] at the [3D geoinformation](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) group of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.
On April 6, 2016, I'll be defending my thesis on the Higher-dimensional modelling of geographic information ([High-quality 200 MB]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/16_thesis.pdf) / [Low-quality 15 MB]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/16_thesis_lowres.pdf)), which I finally finished yesterday. Yay!

I read blogs pretty much every day.
Well, not so much *read* them as *stumble across* them.
When I search for the solution of a problem, most of the time I find it in a <del>scientific paper</del> blog post, a magical corner of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) or a [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)-lookalike.
In fact, I'm insanely grateful to those who make an effort to help others and who document their own problems, but the collective internet has little to show for it.
This blog is a small step towards changing that.

Throughout my PhD, I dealt with plenty of technical issues myself, many of which are undocumented elsewhere and which I plan to (slowly) write about.
I'll also propagandise and vent about the programming I do (C/C++, Ruby, Python), about the tools I love (Mac, LaTeX, Git) and those I love to hate (MS Office, Adobe CC), about the academic good life as a postdoc working remotely from Mexico City, and about all my favourite geekery unrelated from my work.

So, on this pi day, I bid you welcome to my blog!
