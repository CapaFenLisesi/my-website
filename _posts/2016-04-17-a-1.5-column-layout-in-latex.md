Early in my thesis writing process, I decided that I wanted to have a '1.5 column' layout. That is, I wanted to have a layout with wide outer margins where I could place small figures and sidenotes[^1]. Big figures could still go inside the text block, while even bigger figures could use both the text block and the margins. It is similar to the layout that is used in the [BCKO Computational Geometry book](http://www.cs.uu.nl/geobook/) and some journals like [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/).

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-6"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/thesis-1.5-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figures in margins 1" /></div>
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-6"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/thesis-1.5-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figures in margins 2" /></div>
</div>

My reasoning for this was quite simple: I like to use plenty of simple figures to explain ideas, but they result in a lot of wasted space. A narrow text block is more pleasant to read, but it again results in a lot of wasted space. Finally, I love footnotes, but they require the reader to go to the bottom of the page in order to read them and then to find back their place in the text. All of these issues can be solved by a 1.5 column layout with marginal notes instead of footnotes. But how does one make such a layout in LaTeX?

## Paper size and page construction

The B5 paper size used in most theses in the Netherlands is very nice, but it is a little too narrow for this type of layout. So, among the paper sizes available from [Lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com), I decided to go for something more squarish: crown quarto, a British paper format.

Then, I proceeded my read a bit about [page construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons_of_page_construction), which ended up taking a lot of time without giving much insight on how to handle this type of layout. After playing a bit with different ratios, I decided to follow a few typographic rules: the height of the text block should be the same as the width of the page, and the ratio between the inner/top and outer/bottom margins would the golden ratio[^2]. However, after receiving a printed (and bound) proof, I discovered that the inner margins were too small for comfortable reading. So I made them equal to the outer margins in order to account for the space used for binding and cause less strain on the book. After playing with different values, I arbitrarily set the width of the space for marginal notes at 4 cm and the space between the marginal notes and the text block at 0.4 cm. All of this was done using the `geometry` package in the preamble as:

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage[includemp,
            paperwidth=18.90cm,
            paperheight=24.58cm,
            top=2.170cm,
            bottom=3.510cm,
            inner=2.1835cm,
            outer=2.1835cm,
            marginparwidth=4cm,
            marginparsep=0.4cm]{geometry}
{% endhighlight %}

However, I should note that there are certain chapters in which layout doesn't make much sense, such as the bibliography. Non-centred title pages also look sloppy. So, in order to temporarily set a different layout without space for marginal notes for certain chapters, I used:

{% highlight latex %}
\newgeometry{top=2.170cm,
            bottom=3.510cm,
            inner=2.1835cm,
            outer=2.1835cm,
            ignoremp}
{% endhighlight %}

And after such chapters:

{% highlight latex %}
\restoregeometry%
{% endhighlight %}

## Page head and foot

In my opinion, the key to making this kind of layout seem deliberate rather than accidental is to make sure your page head (and foot) extends up to the space used by the marginal notes. For this, I defined a custom length equal to the width of the text block, marginal notes and the space between them as:

{% highlight latex %}
\newlength{\overflowingheadlen}
\setlength{\overflowingheadlen}{\linewidth}
\addtolength{\overflowingheadlen}{\marginparsep}
\addtolength{\overflowingheadlen}{\marginparwidth}
{% endhighlight %}

Then, since I used koma-script, I used the package `scrlayer-scrpage` to create page heads and foots that extended to this length using invisible boxes:

{% highlight latex %}
\renewpagestyle{scrheadings}{
  {\hspace{-\marginparwidth}\hspace{-\marginparsep}\makebox[\overflowingheadlen][l]{\makebox[2em][r]{\thepage}\quad\rule{1pt}{100pt}\quad{}\leftmark}}%
  {\makebox[\overflowingheadlen][r]{\rightmark\quad\rule{1pt}{100pt}\quad\makebox[2em][l]{\thepage}}}%
  {}
}{
  {}%
  {}%
  {}
}
\renewpagestyle{plain.scrheadings}{
  {}%
  {}%
  {}
}{
  {\thepage}%
  {\makebox[\overflowingheadlen][r]{\thepage}}%
  {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Just as before, for the chapters without space for the marginal notes, I had to set up different heads:

{% highlight latex %}
\cleardoublepage%
\renewpagestyle{scrheadings}{
  {\makebox[2em][r]{\thepage}\quad\rule{1pt}{100pt}\quad\leftmark}%
  {\hfill\rightmark\quad\rule{1pt}{100pt}\quad\makebox[2em][l]{\thepage}}%
  {}
}{
  {}%
  {}%
  {}
}
\renewpagestyle{plain.scrheadings}{
  {}%
  {}%
  {}
}{
  {\thepage}%
  {\hfill\thepage}%
  {}
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Figures and tables in margins

As you might know, LaTeX provides `\marginpar`, a simple command to add marginal notes. While most people use this only for text, it is possible to add images inside the `marginpar` environment using `\includegraphics`. However, you cannot add floating environments such as `figure` and `table` inside a `marginpar`. The solution here is to use the `caption` package, which allows you to use `\captionsetup` in order to specify that a certain `marginpar` is actually a figure (or table). As an aside, if you pass the option `hypcap=true` to `caption`, it will load the `hypcap` package so that `hyperref` links go to the top of the figure/table rather than to its caption.

A marginal figure can thus be set up as:

{% highlight latex %}
\marginpar{
\captionsetup{type=figure}
\includegraphics[width=\marginparwidth]{figs/brep}
\caption{A cube represented as the 6 square faces that bound it}
\label{fig:brep}
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Floating marginal environments

A disadvantage of the `marginpar` command is that it puts notes and figures right beside the text where the command is called. While this is fine when you don't have too many things on the margins, things can overflow to the page foot and even outside the page when you have too many of them.

This is very easy to solve, as the `marginfix` makes the environments in the margins float. Everything will be placed as close as possible to where you declare it, but when necessary, things will be moved up or down and never be placed outside the space for marginal notes.

For big documents, it's also a good idea to allow for more unprocessed floats such that you don't get LaTeX errors if too many things remain unplaced:

{% highlight latex %}
\extrafloats{100}
{% endhighlight %}

## Footnotes as sidenotes

This is simple. In order to convert all footnotes into sidenotes, I used the `snotez` package as:

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage[footnote]{snotez}
\setsidenotes{text-mark-format=\textsuperscript{\normalfont#1},
              note-mark-format=#1:,
              note-mark-sep=\enskip}
{% endhighlight %}

## Figures and tables in the text block

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-sm-3 col-xs-3"></div>
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-6"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/thesis-1.5-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Figures with caption in margin" /></div>
	<div class="col-sm-3 col-xs-3"></div>
</div>

With the aforementioned setup, you can still use the usual `figure` and `table` environments to put bigger figures inside the text block. However, I decided to do some extra customisation to use the marginal space for the captions of such figures and tables using the `floatrow` package:

{% highlight latex %}
\floatsetup[figure]{margins=hangoutside,
                    facing=yes,
                    capposition=beside,
                    capbesideposition={center,outside},
                    floatwidth=\textwidth}
\floatsetup[table]{margins=hangoutside,
                   facing=yes,
                   capposition=beside,
                   capbesideposition={center,outside},
                   floatwidth=\textwidth}
{% endhighlight %}

## Big figures and tables using text block and margins

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-sm-3 col-xs-3"></div>
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-xs-6"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/thesis-1.5-4.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Big figures using the text block and marginal space" /></div>
	<div class="col-sm-3 col-xs-3"></div>
</div>

Finally, I set up environments for big figures and tables that use all the width of the text block, marginal note space and the separation in between them. This is also easy using the `floatrow` package:

{% highlight latex %}
\floatsetup[widefigure]{margins=hangoutside,
                        facing=yes,
                        capposition=bottom}
\floatsetup[widetable]{margins=hangoutside,
                       facing=yes,
                       capposition=bottom}
{% endhighlight %}

Such figures and tables can be created using the `figure*` and `table*` environments. For instance, the figure in the example above is created as:

{% highlight latex %}
\begin{figure*}[tbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/konigsberg}
\caption[The Seven Bridges of K\"onigsberg]{The problem of the Seven Bridges of K\"onigsberg asks whether it is possible to find a route through the city that would cross each bridge (highlighted in red) exactly once. \citet{Euler41} proved that there is no such route in terms of a graph. Whenever one enters a piece of land by a bridge, one has to leave it by another bridge except at the beginning or end of the route. Thus, there must be an \emph{even} number of bridges connected to all but (at most) two pieces of land. Since all pieces of land have an \emph{odd} number of bridges, the problem has no solution. Based on an image from a 1613 engraving by Joachim Bering.}
\label{fig:konigsberg}
\end{figure*}
{% endhighlight %}

## Caveats

This setup is by no means perfect. My main annoyance is that if you combine figures in the margins with figures in the text block, they might not be placed in the right order, which requires some manual tweaking to solve. However, it still works pretty well, even with subfigures.

One other aspect to consider with this layout is **sloppy spacing**. LaTeX *really* dislikes uneven inter-word spacing. This is usually fine when the text block is sufficiently wide, where there is enough flexibility to have even spacing (as long as you allow for proper hyphenation, e.g. using `babel`). However, this can cause havoc with narrower text blocks, including our side notes. My solution to this is to use sloppy spacing with the command `\sloppy`[^3]. I also use the `breaklinks=true` option in `hyperref` and the `hyphens` option in `url` as:

{% highlight latex %}
\PassOptionsToPackage{hyphens}{url}\usepackage[
            breaklinks=true]{hyperref}
{% endhighlight %}

[^1]: Instead of footnotes.
[^2]: I find that the 1:2 ratio from koma-script is too much.
[^3]: Yes, sloppy spacing is sloppy, but text that overflows outside the text block is much sloppier. I personally use sloppy spacing in any narrow layout, including all two-column layouts.
